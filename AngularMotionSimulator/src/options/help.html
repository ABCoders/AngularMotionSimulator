<h1 ALIGN=Center>Angular Motion Simulator - By abcCoders</h1>

<p>

<b>Program Features:</b>

<p>The Angular Motion Simulator program is meant to demonstrate Angular Motion using an animated circle and various variables that the user inputs. It can also calculate for a specific variable the user wants and output the process work for the calculations.</p><p>

The circle itself spins according to the angular velocity, sizes itself according to the radius, and moves along the window according to the linear velocity. The animation can be controlled, to a degree, by the sliders provided above the animation and the variable values that the user chooses to input - like angular velocity or radius. </p><p>

The inputs have a button to calculate using the current values given inside them, which outputs the process work inside another window.</p><p>

There is an options menu bar at the top of the program to adjust the animation properties, circle appearance, save. load, or ask for help.</p>

<p><b><i>Program GUI and Instructions</i></b>:</p>

<b>Options Bar</b>:<p>
The options bar has three items, File, Animation, and Other.</p><p>
The File item can be clicked on to show two more items, save and load. The save item can be clicked to save the current information about the animation for later use. The load item can be clicked to load a previous animation that has been saved.</p><p>
The Animation item can be clicked to show items for reversing the direction in which the animation runs, the option to not draw the circle every time the screen is clicked, and the option to undo the user's previous action.</p><p>
Clicking the Other item brings up the options to ask for help, to change the colour of the circle and to change the colour of the points. The Help item pops up a frame that shows this instruction manual and program description in order to help use the program. The Change Circle Color Item changes the colour of the main circle according to what the user picks in the colour chooser window that pops up. The Change Point Color Item does the same for the points that the user can click. The user is free to click a colour and exit out of the colour chooser window and keep their change.</p><p>
The items in the menu all have shortcuts that can be used to access them without having to open the menu. Those shortcuts are written beside all of the items when the user opens the menu.</p><p>

<b>Animation</b>:</p><p>
The animation is a spinning wheel that moves across the screen. It has a slider that can move the animation forwards or backward in time by dragging its marker and a slider that can resize the animation by dragging its marker. The animation has buttons to pause/play and to clear all points. When the animation is paused, the user can click anywhere around it to form a line from the middle of the circle to that point, ending with a point at the point the user clicked on. This can be done multiple times for various points at different parts of the animation. The points can be clicked on and dragged to a wherever the user wants and the line and dot spin and move along with the wheel animation when the play button is clicked. The clear button beside the play button erases the all the points and makes it possible for the user to add others in the same or different places.
</p><p>
The user can also right click the animation points, which allows them to delete the point they are hovering over, or change its colour. <p></p>

<b>Inputting Values</b>:</p><p>
Below the animation is the pane for user inputs. At the top of this pane is the area where the user can choose their wanted variable. This field has a drop down list where the user picks the variable that he/she wishes to calculate for. Beside that drop down list is an area for text where the result for the calculation will appear after the calculate button in the input field is pressed.
</p><p>

The input fields are below the wanted fields. The input fields have a drop down list to pick a given variable that the user wished to enter a value for. Click the drop down list and then click the variable that you want to choose. Right beside that is a text area where the user can enter the values for the variable type that was picked. Click the field and enter the text or click the buttons at the side to increment or decrement your entry, To the right of the text area is the unit that the variable uses in the program and a button, marked with an X, to delete the input field. Press this button to delete the current field it is beside. Below the input fields are two buttons. One says ‘Add’, which adds another input field for extra variable values. The other says ‘Calculate’, which finds the value for the wanted variable based on the variables that have been entered.</p> <p>

If the given variable values do not match up or if they are insufficient for calculating the wanted variable, a dialog box will pop up telling the user to re enter their variables and which other variables are required. Having two variables of the same type in the input fields are not allowed, therefore, an error will pop up telling the user to correct that if it happens.</p><p>

<b>Calculation Process Work</b>:</p><p>
The process work window contains the process work for the calculations used to get the variable value that the user wants. It has the givens on the top of the window, where the values that the user enters are displayed. Below that, it has three lines and a button. The first line is the equation used to get the result. The second line is the same equation, only with the variable types replaced by the actual values the user inputs. The last line is the answer, the result of the calculations and the value of the user’s wanted variable.
</p><p>
The ‘Save’ button below the process work is used to save the calculation to a text file where it can be viewed again on the user’s leisure.</p>
